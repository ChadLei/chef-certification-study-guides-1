# Local Cookbook Development

You can expect this 2 part exam to be tougher than the Basic Chef Fluency badge. It will be heavily focused on Test Kitchen, InSpec, and just basically creating cookbooks. 

If you're rusty, I suggest going through the [kata](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/chef-certification-study-guides/blob/master/basic-chef-fluency/basic-chef-fluency-kata.md) in the Basic Chef Fluency study guide.

Otherwise, study up on the concepts listed in the [guide](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/chef-certification-study-guides/blob/master/local-cookbook-development/local-cookbook-development-study-guide.md).

# Notes about the Exam experience
 - There is not a visible timer, so you have to chat with the proctor to ask how much time is left.
 - You may not use the restroom or else you forfeit the remainder of your time.
 - The setup may take a while since they have to scan your room and workspace.
 - If your internet connection is interrupted, they will give you the lost time, however, this is not ideal, because it makes you frantic and you can't go to the bathroom.
