# Deploying Cookbooks

You can expect this 2 part exam to be tougher than the Basic Chef Fluency badge. This particular badge provides an alternative path to becoming `Certified Chef Developer`, so if you already have `Basic Chef Fluency` and `Local Cookbook Development` badges, then if you pass this badge you will become Certified. Yay!

If you're rusty, I suggest going through the [kata](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/chef-certification-study-guides/blob/master/basic-chef-fluency/basic-chef-fluency-kata.md) in the Basic Chef Fluency study guide.

Otherwise, study up on the concepts listed in the [guide](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/chef-certification-study-guides/blob/master/deploying-cookbooks/deploying-cookbooks-study-guide.md).

## Notes from my test-taking experience
1. Not being able to use dual-screens was a nuisance during the lab.
2. The first like 7 or so questions were nothing I encounter on a regular basis - lots of chef-solo. I had no clue. It felt like a disproportionate amount of questions, not a reflection of real-life use cases (to me, at least).
3. Using docs.chef.io was super awesome - much like real life. 
4. It was not clear to me that I could click on the link to go directly to the chef server UI. I thought I had to configure the connection to chef server manually via the command line, which I’ve never done, so I spent a ton of time messing with that before I realized that I could go into the UI. Hence, I ran out of time and didn’t finish. And the lab questions I did get to were rushed.
5. The lab was great once I figured that out. It was common, everyday stuff that everyone should know. If I had it my way, I would have done more of those questions and less of the first 10 multiple choice, which I feel like weren’t a reflection of my overall knowledge of Chef. 
6. I would have liked to have done the lab first and then the multiple choice questions, for timing.
